# Lab Scenario Preview: GitHub Advanced Security with Azure DevOps

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, we focus on fortifying the security measures within the development environment of the eShopOnWeb project. Throughout these modules, we integrate various security features and protocols into Azure DevOps, leveraging the power of GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS).

Firstly, we configure GitHub Advanced Security within Azure DevOps, enabling enhanced security measures and permissions tailored to the eShopOnWeb project. This involves setting up billing, activating advanced security, and establishing permissions for managing security alerts.

Next, we delve into the implementation of secret scanning in Azure DevOps, aimed at identifying and mitigating potential exposures within the development environment. Participants will learn how to view, fix, and dismiss secret scanning alerts. Thereby enhancing their overall security posture.

Following that, we implement dependency scanning in Azure DevOps to detect and address potential security vulnerabilities in project dependencies. This includes configuring scanning, viewing alerts, fixing identified vulnerabilities, and dismissing resolved alerts to bolster the security of the application.

Moving forward, we will set up code scanning in Azure DevOps using GitHub Advanced Security. This step involves analyzing code for security vulnerabilities and errors, reviewing code scanning alerts, fixing identified issues, and dismissing resolved alerts. Ultimately enhancing the security of the codebase.

Lastly, we connect the Azure DevOps environment to Microsoft Defender for Cloud to further enhance DevOps security. Through this integration, participants will explore the DevOps security findings and inventory provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud, allowing them to review and improve their security posture comprehensively.

Completing these modules will help you gain practical experience in implementing a robust security framework within Azure DevOps. Thus safeguarding your projects against potential threats and vulnerabilities effectively.
