# Introduction to GitHub Advanced Security with Azure DevOps

GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) and Azure DevOps (ADO) are powerful tools that can enhance your development workflow and improve the security of your codebase. Integrating GHAS with ADO leverages the strengths of both platforms to create a more secure and efficient development process. Here's an introduction to help you get started:

## What is GitHub Advanced Security?

GitHub Advanced Security provides a set of security features designed to help developers secure their code and manage vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle. Key features include:

1. **Code Scanning**: Automatically scans your code for security vulnerabilities using GitHub's CodeQL, a powerful static analysis engine.
2. **Secret Scanning**: Detects secrets such as API keys and passwords in your code to prevent accidental exposure.
3. **Dependency Review**: Identifies and reviews security vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.

## What is Azure DevOps?

Azure DevOps is a set of development tools and services provided by Microsoft, which offers:

1. **Azure Repos**: A set of version control tools to manage your code.
2. **Azure Pipelines**: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) that works with any language, platform, and cloud.
3. **Azure Boards**: Agile planning tools to track work with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting.
4. **Azure Test Plans**: Automated and manual testing tools.
5. **Azure Artifacts**: Package management for Maven, npm, NuGet, and more.

## Integrating GitHub Advanced Security with Azure DevOps

Integrating GHAS with ADO can be done through various approaches, combining the security features of GitHub with the powerful development and deployment capabilities of Azure DevOps.

1. **Using GitHub Actions in Azure Pipelines**: You can trigger GitHub Actions workflows from Azure Pipelines to leverage GHAS features like code scanning and secret scanning.

   - **Code Scanning with CodeQL**: Set up CodeQL analysis within a GitHub Action that runs as part of your CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines.
   - **Secret Scanning**: Enable secret scanning in your GitHub repository to detect and manage secrets before they are exposed.

2. **Pull Request Integration**: Use GitHub’s pull request checks to ensure that code changes meet security standards before merging. Integrate these checks with Azure Pipelines to automate the process.

3. **Dependency Management**: Use GitHub’s dependency review feature in conjunction with Azure Artifacts to manage and secure your project dependencies.

## Benefits of Integration

- **Enhanced Security**: By integrating GHAS with ADO, you can catch vulnerabilities early in the development process and ensure that your code is secure before it is deployed.
- **Automated Workflows**: Automate security checks and balances within your CI/CD pipeline to reduce manual effort and improve efficiency.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Gain insights into your security posture with detailed reports and dashboards from both GitHub and Azure DevOps.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Leverage GitHub’s collaborative features alongside Azure DevOps’ project management tools to improve team coordination and productivity.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up GitHub Advanced Security**: Ensure you have the necessary GitHub Advanced Security features enabled for your repository.
2. **Configure Azure DevOps**: Set up your Azure DevOps project and pipelines.
3. **Integrate Workflows**: Create workflows that incorporate GHAS checks into your Azure Pipelines.

By integrating GitHub Advanced Security with Azure DevOps, you can build a robust, secure, and efficient development pipeline that helps you deliver high-quality software with confidence.
